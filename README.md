### 😎 About Me
Hi! My name is Scarlett Gamboa, welcome to my GitHub profile.
 
### 🏫 What I am doing currently
I am a sophmore at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in Edinburg and I am currently minoring in Computer Science. This semester I have been learning C++ and it has inspired me to look into other programming languages such as Java and Python.
